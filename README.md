# 🌌 Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for Multi-Agent Optimization in 2D Space 🚀

Welcome to the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) repository, where you'll find an exciting implementation of PSO and multi-agent systems to search for an optimal point in a 2D space! 🌟

## 📖 Overview

This repository provides an implementation of the PSO algorithm from scratch. PSO is a population-based optimization technique that mimics the movement of particles in a search space, seeking the best possible solution. With the integration of multi-agent systems, these particles work together to achieve collective optimization. 🐦💪

## 🚀 Key Features

- **PSO Algorithm Implementation**: Understand particle initialization, velocity updates, position adjustments, and how fitness evaluations drive the optimization process.

- **2D Space Exploration**:  PSO in a two-dimensional search space. Visualize the particles' dynamic movements as they intelligently navigate the landscape, converging towards the optimal point.

- **Multi-Agent Systems: Particles acting as agents, working together towards a common goal, and achieving superior optimization results.
